This project is an AI-powered image editor built with FastAPI and Gemini (Google GenAI). It allows users to input an image URL and a prompt describing what they want to change in the image. The app then uses Gemini to apply the edit and returns the newly generated image.

Features
Accepts an image via URL input
Takes a text prompt describing the desired edit

Uses Gemini 2.0 Flash to generate AI-edited images

Saves and serves the output image via FastAPI
Easy-to-use POST endpoint (/image/ai_edit)
